# ADHD
Included are the scripts for the mixed effects modeling and elastic net modeling analyses from the article 
Multimethod Investigation of the Neurobiological Basis of ADHD Symptomatology in Children Aged 9-10: Baseline Data from the ABCD Study.

A postprint of this article is available at https://osf.io/425wu/.

These scripts use data from the ABCD RDS file. The RDS file can be downloaded with permission from NDA at https://nda.nih.gov/abcd.

Matlab scripts are currently set to run elastic net regression modeling using the standard covariate approach (i.e., all covariates
but medication status). To run with no covariates or using medication status as a covariate, change the path directories in the preanalysis driver
script.
